    <h2>WELCOME TO NEURO GRIP</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Neuro Grip is a groundbreaking assistive technology project specifically designed to empower individuals living with paralysis by helping them regain control and mobility in their hands. This innovative system seamlessly integrates advanced Arduino microcontrollers, sophisticated logic-level controllers (LLCs), and highly sensitive smart sensors. Together, these components work to accurately detect subtle neural or muscular signals that might otherwise go unnoticed. By interpreting these faint signals in real-time, Neuro Grip translates them into precise, natural hand movements, providing users with enhanced dexterity and independence. This fusion of technology and neuroscience opens new pathways for rehabilitation and everyday assistance, aiming to dramatically improve the quality of life for those affected by paralysis.

  <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
  <section>
    <h2>HOW THE PROJECT WORKS...</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      NEURO GRIP detects weak neural or muscular signals — even in partially responsive limbs —
      through sensors. These signals are processed by Arduino microcontrollers and LLCs, which then
      activate actuators to move the hand.  
      <br><br>
      The prototype uses syringes to perform movements, which mimic the actions of hydraulics, assisting the user to perform their actions with ease
      <br><br>  
      This bridges the gap between the brain’s intent and the body’s response, allowing users to
      perform daily tasks once thought impossible.  
      <br><br>
      More than just hardware, NEURO GRIP represents the intersection of engineering, neuroscience,
      and empathy — restoring independence, dignity, and quality of life.

  <!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->
  <section>
    <h2>WHAT ISSUE DOES THE PROJECT SOLVE...?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Millions of people worldwide live with paralysis, often resulting from traumatic injuries, strokes, or neurological conditions such as spinal cord damage or cerebral palsy. For those affected, even the simplest daily tasks—like holding a pen, eating a meal, or grasping household objects—can become incredibly difficult or even impossible. The loss of hand mobility doesn’t just impact physical functionality; it affects a person’s sense of independence, confidence, and overall quality of life. What many take for granted becomes a daily struggle, making assistive solutions not just helpful, but truly life-changing.
        
      <br><br>
      NEURO GRIP offers a direct and practical response to this challenge by providing a low-cost, portable, and highly effective solution designed to restore essential hand functionality. Through the intelligent use of accessible hardware and responsive technology, it enables users to perform everyday tasks that were once out of reach. By focusing on usability, affordability, and real-world impact, NEURO GRIP doesn’t just restore movement — it restores dignity, independence, and confidence, allowing individuals to reclaim control over their lives and engage more fully with the world around them.
